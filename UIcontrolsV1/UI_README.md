# User Interface Subsystem Control Code
This folder contains the UI control code to be able to inform the user and audience on the current status of the subsystem. 
The code will handle the signal processing from the user interface components and the extract data from the user input components.

User Interface Components:
LED Strip - give visual cues on the timing and target aquisition of the system
Speaker - give audio cues for build up on the locking procedure and will ring a melody when a successful hit is shown
Button - will act as the trigger in order to begin the target acquisition phase
Potentiometer - indicated by the user that sets the timing of the lock on
