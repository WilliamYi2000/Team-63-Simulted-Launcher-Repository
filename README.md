## General info
The simulated rocket launcher is intended to be used as a training device for instructing soldiers on the proper use of an electronic targeting system. The system will consist of two separate parts, a launcher and a target, each using a microcontroller and suite of sensors to send and receive data. These microcontrollers will also control peripheral systems, such as a user interface and feedback system on the launcher side, so as to notify the user of successful target acquisition, and an alarm system in the target to notify bystanders of a successful lock. The end product is intended to be used as a training device by soldiers to practice the proper use of a rocket launcher and assisted targeting system. As a device made specifically for training on targeting systems, the launcher will not fire a projectile. To test this device, successful lock will be made between the launcher and target at various ranges and with various settings of the variable timing circuit.
