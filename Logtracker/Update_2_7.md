# Progress Tracker
## Radio Subsystem - William Yi
I updated calibration code for target lock-on
I updated hit-detection algorithm for three antennas
I am now integrating radios to the target.
I plan to update the hit-detection algoritm after further testing with the target. 
## Target Chasis - William Yi
I got the target board and put together the target stands.
I am now integrating the board with the target microcontroller, peripherals, and radio antennas.
I plan to update the target with additonal chasis to hold our peripherals.
## Target Control PCB - Mark Tressler
I completed the target control PCB - constructed 4 boards.
Target control PCB has been integrated with radio subsystems and is ready to be integrated with chassis and power.
I plan to integrate this system with other systems this week.
## Launcher Control PCB - Chris Bauman
The board is ordered and on its way so it can be assembled and tested with current code
Looking to integrate with radio modules and target contoller, by end of this week
## User Interface Components - Chris Bauman
Recieved new UI parts and PCB comoponents for the new board
Tested the functionality of the UI components
Going to test these with the finalized target and launcher control PCB
## Launcher Chassis - Dalton Ferguson
The launcher chassis is fully 3D printed.
I have assembled what is possible at the moment and require final measurments for internal boards and components befor I can fully assemble.
I expect the launcher to be fully assembled by the end of next week.
## Power Supply - Dalton Ferguson
The power supply was completed and fully verified by the end of 403.
We have continued to use the power PCB to power the control PCBs so that they can be used without a computer.
I am going to create a two battery input harness instead of a harness for a single battery and more permanent stwitch connection.
